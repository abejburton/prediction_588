Models for Probit, Logit, and LPM prediction with data generated to show their relative merits

The LPM model follows the closed form OLS method while Probit and Logit minimize their respective log likelihood functions to get model coefficients. Data was generated with a logistic and normal error to test the different performance of the models.
